## üî• I learned to:

- Develop a full frontend application on ReactJS.
- Create components, pages, sorting, search, paging, filtering, popup-windows, etc.
- Interact with the server part, send backend requests.
- Develop navigation on the page without rebooting.
- Create a global data warehouse for the entire application.
- Write strictly typed code in TypeScript.
- Work with LocalStorage to store site settings.
- Lazy Loading (lazy loading) + debounce (optimization for finding pizzas).
- Optimize redraw/rerender components, code splitting (code splitting into separate JS files), what is tree shaking and how to reduce component imports.
- Make adaptive typesetting.
- Deplete app on internet
- etc.
